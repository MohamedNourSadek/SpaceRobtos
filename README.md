# Space Robots
A Freelance project to recreate an old game (2013) to current generation Unity and C#, it’s basically collection of resources, using resources to create robots, and join fights with them.
- It’s an online mobile game.
- Networking using Photon Networks, and user database on Playfab.
- Created completely by myslef using videos of the old game as a reference, and 2D assets from the old project.
